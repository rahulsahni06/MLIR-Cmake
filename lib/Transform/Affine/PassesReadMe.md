Notes:
1. Tablegen generates all of the boilerplate code. In the Affine pass, all the generated code related to the pass in saved in `Passes.h.inc` and the code is wrapped arround with macros like `GEN_PASS_DECL_AFFINEFULLUNROLL` or `GEN_PASS_DEF_AFFINEFULLUNROLL`.
2. The generated code has code for defining the pass, and registering the pass to the tool like `tutorial-opt` which in this example is a wrapper for  `mlir-opt`
3. We need to create appropriate c++ header files and implementation code for the defined passes and we need to include the code from the `Passes.h.inc`. In the example, we have created `AffineFullUnroll.h` and `AffineFullUnroll.cpp` by using the macros `GEN_PASS_DEC_AFFINEFULLUNROLL` and  `GEN_PASS_DECL_AFFINEFULLUNROLL` respsectively. We can also define the missing method like `runOperation()` in the same way.
3. The generated code doesn't have the `runOperation()` for the Pass. There might be other instances where the generated code is missing some functions. This is where the c++ comes in. We need to define the corresponding header files and the code which defines the implements the missing method. We need to use the appropriate macros to define those missing functions. Like, in the case of `AffineFullUnroll` we need to use the `GEN_PASS_DEF_AFFINEFULLUNROLL` to define the `runOperation()` in `AffineFullUnroll.cpp` and
